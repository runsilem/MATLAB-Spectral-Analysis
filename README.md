# 🌟 Spectral Analysis in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script that simulates stellar spectral data and performs analysis to identify the Hydrogen-alpha (Hα) absorption line. The project is inspired by tasks from the [MATLAB Onramp course](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/v1/portal.html?course=gettingstarted#chapter=9v1&lesson=1&section=1) and adapted for independent exploration and sharing.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Simulates spectral intensity data across a range of wavelengths
- Plots the spectrum and highlights the Hα absorption line
- Calculates the radial velocity of a star using Doppler shift
- Demonstrates basic MATLAB skills: vector operations, plotting, indexing, and physical interpretation

## 📁 Files

- `spectral_analysis.m`: Main script with all tasks completed and annotated
- *(Optional)* `starData.mat`: Original dataset used in MATLAB Onramp (not included here; simulated data is used instead)

## 📊 Sample Output

- A plot of intensity vs. wavelength
- A red marker indicating the Hα line
- Console output showing:
  - Observed Hα wavelength
  - Calculated radial velocity in km/s

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `.m` file.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing the script.
3. Run `spectral_analysis.m`.
4. View the plot and check the console for results.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Gaussian modeling of spectral lines
- Doppler effect and redshift calculation
- MATLAB plotting and annotation
- Indexing and data extraction
